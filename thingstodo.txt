frontend:

after the program is finished. Think about the reorganization of the widgets





backend:
remove the {} that appear in the ListBox (Convert ListBox to Treeview)
update the search function to be case insensitive




export:
make it so that the app tells you if the file name already exists (maybe...)
Make the window2 centered to window1
make the second window close after saving the file (i can't)
